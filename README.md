# NodeJS-ExpressJS-MongoDB-CRUD
I created documentation for a simple CRUD system on Node JS with a MongoDB database

sorry I didn't include the node_modules folder because it exceeds 100 files.

If you want to use this code you have to install the package :
1. express
2. mongoose
3. cors
on your code.

good luck!
